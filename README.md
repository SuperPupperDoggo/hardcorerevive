# HardcoreRevive

This Spigot/PaperMC allows people to get revived by other players when they die in hardcore mode.

## How does it work?

When someone dies, the player can then join the spectator mode. After that, a message 
is sent into the chat to all players with the position and world where the player died. 
After that, a player needs to go to the position where the player has died and needs to
sneak around 10 times *(modifiable in config)* to fulfil the revive ceremony. After that,
the player is respawned at the death location *(or at the world spawn, when specified
in the config)*.

You can also specify a timeout in the config until the player needs to be revived. 
After that time, the player is clinically dead and can not be revived.
